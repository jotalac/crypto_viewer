## Description

This project is a simple yet powerful cryptocurrency price viewer. It fetches real-time data from a cryptocurrency API and displays it on a screen. The device is housed in a 3D-printed case and features button controls and a buzzer for notifications.

## Features

*   **Real-time Price Tracking:** Fetches and displays up-to-date cryptocurrency prices.
*   **Display:** Shows data on a clear and readable screen.
*   **Button Controls:** Navigate through different cryptocurrencies or settings.
*   **Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts for price changes or other events.
*   **3D-Printed Case:** A custom-designed case to house all the components.
*   **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Connects to your local network to access the internet.
